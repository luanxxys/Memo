### Theory & Algorithm

---

The optimization process is a Minimax game problem, and the optimization goal is to achieve the Nash equilibrium

### PROs and CONs

---

PROs

- Markov chains are never needed

        only backprop is used to obtain gradients

- No inference is needed during learning

- A wide variety of functions can be incorporated into the model

- GAN can be combined with CNN and RNN

---

CONs

- There is no explicit representation of Pg(x)

- D must be synchronized well with G during training
